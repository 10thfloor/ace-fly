#Problems with traditional IaC

Traditional IaC, like the Terraform and Pulumi, are made up of low level resources. This has a couple of implications:

You need to understand how each of these low level resources work. You need to know what the properties of a resource does.

You need a lot of these low level resources. For example, to deploy a Next.js app on Fly.io, you need a bunch of these low-level resources.

This makes IaC really intimidating for most developers. Since you need very specific Fly.io knowledge to even deploy a simple CRUD app. As a result, IaC has been traditionally only used by DevOps or Platform engineers.

Additionally, traditional IaC tools donâ€™t help you with local development. They are only concerned with how you define and deploy your infrastructure.
